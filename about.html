        <h3>SANDRA MARIA JOSE</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm <span>SANDRA</span>, a passionate Computer Science
          Engineering student currently pursuing my B.Tech degree at , SJCET.
          I'm on a journey to explore the ever-evolving world of technology and
          create a meaningful impact through my work. I'm currently in my 7th
          semester of B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at SJCET. I've
          always been drawn to the world of programming, algorithms, and
          cutting-edge technology. My coursework has equipped me with a strong
          foundation in various aspects of computer science, and I'm always
          eager to expand my knowledge.My love for coding and problem-solving is
          what drives me. I find joy in building software solutions and delving
          into challenging projects. In my free time, you can often find me
          experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks, or
          working on personal coding projects. It's not just a field of study
          for me; it's a true passion. ### Skills - Proficient in languages like
          Python, Java - Experienced with web development technologies (HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript) - Familiar with data structures and algorithms -
          Version control using Git and GitHub - Problem-solving and critical
          thinking I've had the pleasure of working on: E-commerce Website
          Developed a fully functional e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, allowing users to browse products, add items to their
          cart, and complete purchases. ### Career Goals My ultimate goal is to
          leverage my skills and knowledge to make a difference in the tech
          industry. I aspire to work on innovative projects that solve
          real-world problems, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie
          ahead in the fields of software development, artificial intelligence,
          and data science. I'm an active member of the IEEE,CSI at SJCET, where
          I've had the privilege to collaborate on exciting tech-related events
          and projects. I've also volunteered for community coding workshops,
          sharing my knowledge with others. Thank you for visiting my portfolio
